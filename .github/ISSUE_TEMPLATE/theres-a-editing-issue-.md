What is the name of the commercial/s  file?

What is the commercial/s type (Cars_And_Trucks, Food_And_Drink, Game_Systems, Etc)?

What is the commercial/s about ?

What is wrong with the file?

Keep in mind that video/audio issue/quality i can do nothing about. some of these are from old vhs rips.

How can i fix this then, simple only with a high quality rip or if some one cleans up the rip in better editing soft then what i have. if this is what you want to submit then please use the upgrade issue.
