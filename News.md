<br />

debanded the Commercial Pack for use with other projects. also movie trailers are coming soon and still working on 80's pack


<br />
Commercial Pack
V2.0.0-Beta the old pack will be going offline from my end if you guys like to keep seed go right ahead.
whats new in this pack better file names and folder structure. as well of C-Codes or Commercial-codes. this is short filenames in the name to help sort out even more.

**old news** <br />
that time has finally come my mega account is maxed out and i dont want to spend the money to upgrade. so will more on to torrent power.
also will look in to uploading to archive https://archive.org/
for now will stick with just torrent

all files will be auto converted into mkv's in h.265 Codecs this will save space as well as download time.

The torrent is now live. sorry for the long wait but i had uploading issues, which sould be fixed now. i have tested it on 2 clients, and worked fine. if it doesnt for you just submit a issue.
